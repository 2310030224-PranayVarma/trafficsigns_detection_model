# Traffic Sign Detection Using CNN

This project implements a traffic sign detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset. The system is capable of detecting traffic signs from images and classifying them based on trained models.

## Overview
This project trains a CNN to classify traffic signs using the GTSRB dataset. The model achieves high accuracy on the test set and can be used to classify traffic signs from user-uploaded images through a simple GUI.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gertraffic-data), which contains over 50,000 images of 43 different types of traffic signs. 

The dataset contains:
- **Meta folder**: Metadata related to the dataset.
- **Test folder**: Images for testing.
- **Train folder**: Images for training, each subfolder represents a class.

## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for traffic sign detection consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: For extracting features from the images.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: For downsampling.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers to make predictions.
- **Activation**: ReLU activation for hidden layers and softmax for output layer.
  
The model is trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_sign_detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd traffic_sign_detection
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Download and extract the [GTSRB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gertraffic-data) into the `data` directory of the project. Ensure the structure is as follows:
    ```
    data/
      GTSRB/
        Train/
        Test/
        Meta/
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```

The trained model will be saved as `traffic_sign_model.h5` in the `model/` directory.

### Testing with GUI

1. After training the model, you can test it by running the GUI for image testing.

2. Run the GUI:
    ```bash
    python src/gui.py
    ```

3. In the GUI, click "Upload Image" to select an image of a traffic sign. The model will classify the image and display the predicted traffic sign.

```

## Results
After training, the model achieves a test accuracy of approximately **99.2%** on the GTSRB dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the model's ability to correctly classify traffic signs.
